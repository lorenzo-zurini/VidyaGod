# VidyaGod — Backlog (from the 2026-06-22 test pass)

Living list of what's queued. Done items kept for context. Test plan checklist is in `TESTPLAN.md`.

## In progress
- **Download throughput** — sequential fetch was RTT-bound ~4 MB/s; parallel/windowed/session attempts gave
  150 MB/s bursts but periodic "waiting for peers" stalls (every ~3-4 s). Being benchmarked + optimized headlessly
  on the laptop (`--import-package`). Goal: steady link-speed downloads.

## Pending bugs
- (none — #2/#3/#5/#8/#9 fixed; see "Done this session")

## Deferred tests (need state we didn't have)
- **B11** — collapse/expand a Series section: needs ≥2 games in one series in the Library.
- **I41** — edit a package while its PreLaunchWindow is open → the dialog reloads. Needs a launchable game (runner).
- **J42–J45** — launch flow (prelaunch layout, runner gate, inspect-runtime cleanup, run end-to-end). Needs an
  imported runner (Proton-GE) + a hydrated Windows game (AoE2).

## Larger tasks
- **De-god `PackageEditor`** (1646 LOC) — same AppModel/section-widget treatment as MainWindow. User: "packageeditor
  is a mess right now". Next de-god target; the resolver/`ContainerWrapper` (2212 LOC) is the other god object but
  higher risk — harden + unit-test the pure resolver seam first.
- **Commit `TESTPLAN.md`** (currently untracked).

## Done this session (for reference)
- #1 dup repo rejected · #4 download UI freeze (cover re-scale per tick + BuildCidLabels disk-rescan on GUI thread +
  progress throttle) · #6 slow pinning (batched finalize) · #7 cancelled row dropped · #10 app-data field grayed.
- **#2** content guard — `PackageCatalog::NodeHasContent` (closure defines ≥1 VFS content layer) gates
  `LibraryTab::buildCards` + `PackagesView::rebuildList`, so vacuously-hydrated content-less packages are hidden.
- **#3** size-weighted progress — `DownloadManager::applyProgress` weights each CID's % by its byte size
  (`DownloadCidSize`, filled off-thread via `CidSize`), falling back to equal-weight; no more jerky bar.
- **#5** status-coded transfer bars — `StatusRole` + `TransferStatus` enum; `ProgressBarDelegate` colours queued
  purple / downloading blue / pinning dark-green / stalled amber / errored red, set at every transition.
- **#8 + #9** remove-flow rework — `PackageCatalog::DehydrateNode` (inverse of HydrateNode: deletes content-layer
  files, keeps manifest+cover, unpins+DropRefs the CIDs). `AppModel::removePackage` de-hydrates managed packages
  (under LibraryRoot) keeping manifest+cover+LIBRARY entry → package returns to Catalog; local/portable packages
  only drop the LIBRARY reference, never touch the user's files (TESTPLAN E28 preserved).
- Cancel purges the partial (DropCached) · crash/close persists + resumes (Settings.ActiveDownloads) · download
  drops a stale/orphaned ref and re-fetches instead of "missing files".
- Covers: re-pin by reference (additive/overwrite seed modes; orphans re-pointed); HydrateNode seeds a present
  cover; node primitives VgDropRef / VgHasLocal / VgDropCached.
- The whole AppModel signal-hub refactor (MainWindow 1929→148) — runtime-validated, no architecture bugs found.
